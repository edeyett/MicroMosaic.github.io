  <div class="about-highlight teal align-right">
    <p>I’m a microbial ecologist with a PhD in Genetics, Genomics & Bioinformatics, and my home base has always been environmental microbiology. Field work taught me to listen to ecosystems; graduate training gave me the tools to decode genomes; industry engagements showed me how fragile data culture can be when those threads are disconnected. MicroMosaic is the studio where I keep them together for organizations that want depth without hiring three different consultants.</p>

## What MicroMosaic Stands For

<div class="about-highlight golden align-left">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scientific integrity stays intact.</strong> If rigor or ethics are at risk, we pause instead of polishing the wrong answer.</li>
    <li><strong>Microbes are collaborators.</strong> Language, visuals, and strategy keep ecological context in view.</li>
    <li><strong>Clarity belongs to everyone.</strong> Research teams, executives, and community stakeholders all deserve the full picture.</li>
    <li><strong>Care is operational.</strong> Collaboration is dialog-driven, humane, and transparent about trade-offs.</li>
  </ul>
</div>


## How Engagements Feel

<div class="about-highlight crimson align-right">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery & Scoping</strong> – We map the scientific problem, existing data, and desired outcomes together. No black boxes.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> – Expect shared documents, working sessions, and transparent decision logs. MicroMosaic often functions as a fractional teammate.</li>
    <li><strong>Delivery & Transition</strong> – Reports and case studies arrive with interpretation, next steps, and materials you can hand directly to stakeholders.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Roots & Reach

<div class="about-highlight golden align-left">
  <p>I work remotely and collaborate comfortably across time zones. I’ve helped scale fungal and bacterial R&D in environmental biotech, supported multi-lab plant–microbe research programs, and built science communication projects from the ground up — including conference programming and collaborative sci-comm work. MicroMosaic is launching to bring that same blend of rigor and creative translation to new partners who need science that holds up and connects.</p>
