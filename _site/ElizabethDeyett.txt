Primary Website Introduction

Elizabeth Deyett, PhD is a microbial bioinformatician, data strategist, and science communicator who helps organizations make sense of complex biological data — without stripping it of meaning, context, or integrity.

With over a decade of experience across environmental microbiology, genomics, cloud-native bioinformatics, and data governance, Elizabeth works at the intersection of analysis, strategy, and storytelling. She is known for building scalable, reproducible systems and for translating results into narratives, visuals, and decisions that scientists, leaders, and stakeholders can actually use.

What sets Elizabeth apart is not just technical depth — spanning bacterial and fungal genomics, metagenomics, experimental design, and enterprise-grade data infrastructure — but how she works. Her approach is collaborative, human-centered, and deeply intentional. She treats interpretation as a shared process, communication as a responsibility, and data as something that should empower teams rather than mystify them.

Clients work with Elizabeth when they need more than analysis in isolation: when they want a thoughtful scientific partner who can design systems, surface insight, communicate clearly across audiences, and hold rigor, creativity, and care in the same room.
