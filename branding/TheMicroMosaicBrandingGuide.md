# 🧬 MicroMosaic Branding Guide

**Implementation & Design Manual (Derived from the MicroMosaic Field Guide)**

> **Canonical Source of Truth:** The *MicroMosaic Field Guide* governs mission, positioning, philosophy, services, voice, and ethics.
> This branding guide does **not redefine** MicroMosaic. It exists solely to **translate the Field Guide into practical, repeatable decisions** for website design, visuals, copy, and client-facing materials.

## 0. How to Use This Document

Use this guide when you are asking:

* “Does this *feel* like MicroMosaic?”
* “Is this too academic / too poetic / too vague?”
* “How do I express rigor *and* creativity without diluting either?”
* “What design or copy choice best reflects the Field Guide?”

If something here conflicts with the Field Guide, **the Field Guide wins**.

## 1. Brand Voice — Application Rules (Not Redefinition)

### Canonical Voice (from Field Guide)

MicroMosaic’s brand voice is:

* **Intelligent, grounded, and precise**
* **Warm, empathetic, and open** — without sacrificing rigor
* **Authentic and plain‑spoken** — no posturing, no performance
* **Passionate and visibly invested** in the science and its impact
* **Collaborative and invitational** — dialog‑driven, non‑hierarchical
* **Confident and values‑anchored** — clear in expertise and boundaries, willing to compromise *only* when aligned with ethics
* **Embracing and generous** — curious about other perspectives, generous with knowledge
* **Poetic and mythic when it serves understanding**, never when it obscures it

This voice should feel human, credible, and alive — never corporate, sanitized, or performative.

This guide defines **where and how** to apply that voice.

---

### Microbial Respect & Framing Clause

MicroMosaic language and visuals treat microbes with respect, curiosity, and ecological awareness.

* Microbes are framed as **ecological actors and systems participants**, not enemies or contaminants
* Language avoids fear-based, moralized, or deficit-oriented framing by default
* Complexity, context, and relationship are preferred over simplification or alarm
* When pathogenicity or risk is discussed, it is done **precisely, contextually, and without sensationalism**

This applies across copy, visuals, metaphors, and educational framing.

---

### Voice by Context

**Homepage / About / Talks / Workshops**

* Light poetic framing is acceptable
* Metaphor may be used *after* clarity is established
* Emotional resonance is allowed
* Curiosity-forward language encouraged

**Case Studies / Service Pages / Proposals**

* Clear, direct, concrete
* Narrative is explanatory, not lyrical
* Focus on decisions, outcomes, and interpretation
* Metaphor only if it clarifies a process or result

**Technical Reports / Methods / Governance / Audit-Adjacent Work**

* Zero mythic framing
* Precision over tone
* Explicit assumptions, limits, and uncertainty
* Plain language > elegance

**Rule of Thumb:**
If the reader must *trust* the output, clarity always overrides style.

---

### Common Failure Modes (Avoid)

* Sounding like an academic paper on the website
* Sounding like a creative studio with no scientific backbone
* Overusing metaphor where a sentence of explanation would suffice
* Hiding uncertainty instead of naming it
* **LinkedIn‑style professionalism**: buzzword soup, forced optimism, sanitized corporate affect, performative “thought‑leader” theater, hollow confidence, or any language that prioritizes optics over truth

**What this means in practice:**

* Avoid empty phrases like “excited to share,” “thrilled to announce,” or generic leadership platitudes
* Avoid performative empathy that names feelings without offering substance
* Avoid polish that erases conviction, boundaries, or ethical stance
* Prefer directness, care, and grounded confidence over branding theater

## 2. Visual Identity — Applied Guidance

---

## Collaboration Ethos (How the Work Feels)

MicroMosaic works *with* people, not over them.

Collaboration is dialog-driven, iterative, and grounded in shared sense-making. Interpretation is treated as a collective process, where questions, uncertainty, and partial understanding are welcomed rather than hidden. Expertise is exercised without dominance, and leadership shows up as clarity, care, and follow-through — not control.

This ethos should be reflected in:

* Copy that invites conversation rather than instruction
* Case studies that highlight shared reasoning, not just outputs
* Visuals that emphasize process, flow, and connection

---

## Ethics-in-Action: When MicroMosaic Says No

Scientific integrity and values alignment take precedence over speed, optics, or convenience.

MicroMosaic will respectfully decline or redirect work that:

* Compromises scientific rigor, transparency, or reproducibility
* Requires fear-based framing, hype, or misrepresentation of results
* Conflicts with ethical standards, ecological responsibility, or honest communication

Saying no is part of the practice — not a failure of collaboration, but a commitment to trust, integrity, and long-term impact.

## 2. Visual Identity — Applied Guidance

### Color Palette (Canonical — from prior guide)

| Color            | Hex     | Usage                            |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------------------------------- |
| Emerald Teal     | #1D6D6E | Primary headers, links, accents  |
| Crimson Mycelium | #912F40 | CTAs, emphasis (sparingly)       |
| Fungal Gold      | #D9A441 | Icons, dividers, highlights      |
| Blackberry Rust  | #3A2D32 | Body text                        |
| Petri White      | #F1F1EC | Primary background               |
| Mycelial Mist    | #7CA7A7 | Secondary backgrounds / callouts |

**Application Rules:**

* Default to calm, neutral layouts
* Crimson is for *intentional emphasis only*
* Avoid high-contrast, aggressive color blocking

---

### Typography — Usage Rules

**Cormorant Garamond**

* Headers, section titles, pull quotes
* Use sparingly for emphasis and hierarchy

**Lato**

* Body text, navigation, captions, metadata
* Must remain highly readable

**Avoid:**

* Dense text blocks
* Small font sizes
* Decorative fonts beyond these two

---

### Imagery & Texture

**Preferred:**

* Abstract or semi-abstract microbial / network visuals
* Process-oriented visuals (diagrams, flows, systems)
* White space

**Use Carefully:**

* Literal microscopy imagery
* Stock lab photography

**Avoid:**

* Sci‑fi aesthetics
* Overly literal pathogen‑centric or fear‑based microbe visuals
* Anything that undermines seriousness or ethics

---

## 3. Website Structure — Field Guide → Web Translation

### Homepage Must Answer (In Order)

1. What MicroMosaic does
2. Who it is for
3. What problem it solves
4. How it works (at a high level)
5. Proof via case studies or examples

**Homepage Copy Rules:**

* No long philosophy blocks
* No buzzwords
* No unexplained jargon

---

### Services Pages

Services should be framed as **capabilities**, not rigid packages.

Each service page should include:

* What problem this helps solve
* What collaboration looks like
* What outputs typically include
* How interpretation and communication are handled

Avoid:

* Overly long lists without context
* Tool-first framing without purpose

---

### Case Studies (Critical)

Case studies are the **primary credibility engine**.

Each case study should include:

1. Context & constraints
2. The scientific or data challenge
3. What was done (at the right technical level)
4. Interpretation & decisions enabled
5. Outcome / impact

Tone:

* Concrete
* Grounded
* Decision-oriented

---

## 4. Copy & Microcopy Standards

### CTAs

Preferred tone:

* Invitational
* Low-pressure
* Collaborative

Examples:

* “Start a conversation”
* “Talk through your project”
* “Explore working together”

Avoid:

* Sales-heavy language
* Urgency tactics

---

### First-Person Voice

* First-person singular (“I”) is acceptable when reflecting lived experience
* First-person plural (“we”) when describing MicroMosaic as a practice
* Never inflate team size or imply scale that doesn’t exist

---

## 5. Consistency Checks (Use as a Litmus Test)

Ask before publishing anything:

* Is this aligned with scientific integrity?
* Does this prioritize clarity over performance?
* Would a scientist trust this?
* Would a non-expert understand why it matters?
* Does this empower the reader, not impress them?

If the answer to any is “no,” revise.

---

## 6. What This Guide Does *Not* Do

This guide does **not**:

* Redefine mission or positioning
* Introduce new archetypes
* Replace the Field Guide
* Lock the brand into static language

It exists to make the Field Guide *usable*.

---

## 7. Living Document Note

This branding guide should evolve alongside:

* New case studies
* Website iterations
* Visual system refinements

All changes must remain consistent with the **MicroMosaic Field Guide**.

---

*MicroMosaic succeeds when rigor, meaning, and communication stay in the same room.*
